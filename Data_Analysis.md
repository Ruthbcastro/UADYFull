## Identifying Patterns in Results

1. **Predominance of Software Engineering Students**: A large majority of the respondents are from the Software Engineering program. This may indicate a biased sample or a particular interest in mental health services from this field. To draw more generalizable conclusions, a more representative sample from all programs at UADY would be needed.
2. **High Willingness to Use the Application (with nuances)**: While many respondents are open to using an appointment app for psychological services at a preferential price, a significant number are unsure or reject it. Desired frequency of use varies, with responses ranging from "rarely", "occasionally", "regularly", to "frequently".
3. **Main Reasons for Seeking Psychological Services**: The most common reasons for seeking psychological services are stress management (personal and academic) and mental health issues (anxiety and depression). These align with typical student life pressures.
4. **Most Important Features of the Application**: The most valued features in the app include ease of scheduling appointments, access to psychologists with specific specialties, and flexibility in choosing appointment times. Online options are also highly desired. There is significant interest in detailed psychologist profiles, automatic reminders, and an intuitive interface.
5. **Main Concerns**: The biggest concerns focus on session confidentiality, quality of care, and costs. Data privacy and online platform security are also important.
6. **Relationship Between Frequency of Use and Concerns**: Those indicating higher usage frequency ("frequently" or "regularly") tend to show more concern about the quality of care, confidentiality, and data privacy. This suggests that service reliability is crucial for consistent use.
7. **Relationship Between Program and Concerns/Desired Features**: While not an overwhelming pattern, there is a trend of greater demand for app functionalities (such as integration with other health services) among students in computing and mathematics. This may be due to their greater familiarity with technology or access to resources.

## Hypotheses about Potential Users:

### 1. **Users with Immediate Needs**:
- **Characteristics**: High stress or mental health issues that require immediate or frequent attention. Often experiencing severe anxiety, panic attacks, or intense depression, they seek quick and accessible solutions.
- **Needs**: Ease of scheduling (ideally same-day or next-day appointments), access to highly available psychologists, online session options, clear cost information, fast and intuitive registration process, and progress tracking system.

### 2. **Users with Periodic Needs**:
- **Characteristics**: Need regular psychological support, but not urgently. Seek long-term follow-up for chronic issues or general well-being. Report moderate to high stress related to academic or personal life and desire a stable, continuous solution.
- **Needs**: Ease of scheduling recurring appointments, access to psychologists with relevant specialties (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), appointment reminders, therapeutic progress tracking, communication with the psychologist between sessions.

### 3. **Users with Specific Needs**:
- **Characteristics**: Seeking psychological help for specific issues (e.g., eating disorders, social anxiety, relationship problems, grief). Require psychologists with experience and expertise in these areas.
- **Needs**: Access to psychologists with specific specialties, detailed and verified information about each psychologistâ€™s experience and approach, pre-consultation to assess therapist compatibility, and a review and rating system from other users.

### 4. **Indecisive/Cautious Users**:
- **Characteristics**: Unsure about needing therapy or hesitant to use an app for psychological services. Concerned about confidentiality, service quality, and costs.
- **Needs**: Clear and transparent information about how the app works, guarantees of confidentiality and data security (with accessible privacy policy), testimonials or reviews from other users to validate the experience, and a process for initial consultation to resolve doubts.

### 5. **Users with Time Constraints**:
- **Characteristics**: Have busy schedules and need an efficient, easy-to-use app. Prioritize speed and convenience in accessing services.
- **Needs**: Quick appointment scheduling, online session options, appointment reminders, an intuitive interface, easy calendar management, and progress tracking system.

### 6. **Users Seeking Self-Help**:
- **Characteristics**: May have stress or issues but first look for self-help resources before seeking therapy.
- **Needs**: Access to self-help resources (e.g., articles, guided meditations, breathing exercises), practical guides for managing stress and anxiety, and a clear path to connect with a psychologist if self-help is insufficient.

---

### Hypothesis:

There should be a relationship between:
- **Need for psychological attention (urgency and frequency)**,
- **Desired features in the app**, and
- **Concerns about confidentiality and costs**.

---

### Relationship Between Variables:

- **Users with immediate needs and high frequency**: These users prioritize ease of scheduling, immediate availability of psychologists, online session options, and a simple interface. Cost concerns might be secondary to the need for quick attention, though confidentiality remains crucial. **Example**: Students with severe anxiety, depression, or crisis situations.
  
- **Users with periodic needs**: These users look for ease in scheduling recurring appointments, choosing psychologists with specific specialties, appointment reminders, and tracking progress. Confidentiality and quality of care are highly relevant, with moderate concern about costs. **Example**: Students with chronic stress, interpersonal relationship issues, or those seeking long-term therapy.
  
- **Users with specific needs**: These users prioritize psychologists with expertise in particular areas (e.g., eating disorders, relationship issues). Detailed profiles and therapist expertise are crucial, with high concern about quality of care. Confidentiality and specialization are more important than cost concerns. **Example**: Students with specific disorders requiring specialized professionals.
  
- **Indecisive or cautious users**: Concerns about confidentiality and costs are high for these users. They need clear information about how the app works, security guarantees, user testimonials, and a process for initial contact to resolve doubts. **Example**: Students hesitant to use apps for mental health due to privacy or quality concerns.
  
- **Users with time constraints**: These users prioritize speed and efficiency. They need an intuitive interface, fast appointment scheduling, online session options, and reminders. Confidentiality is important, but ease of use and quick processes may take precedence over cost or the search for a specialized professional, if not urgently needed. **Example**: Students with very busy schedules.

## Relevant Findings

The following points stand out:

- **High Demand for Mental Health Services**: The dataset shows a high proportion of students reporting stress, anxiety, and depression, indicating significant unmet demand for mental health services among the student population. This validates the need for an app that facilitates access to these services.
- **Variety of Care Needs**: Respondents show a wide diversity in the urgency and frequency of their mental health needs, ranging from crisis situations to seeking long-term support. This suggests that the app should be flexible and adaptable to individual needs.
- **Ease of Access**: The ease of scheduling appointments, availability of online sessions, and clarity of cost information are crucial factors for users. The app should optimize these aspects to improve accessibility to services.
- **Concerns about Privacy and Confidentiality**: The confidentiality of sessions and the security of personal data are significant concerns for users, indicating the need to implement strong security measures and a clear, transparent privacy policy.
- **Need for Clear and Detailed Information on Psychologists**: Access to detailed information about psychologistsâ€™ profiles, including their experience, specialization, and therapeutic approach, is key to fostering user trust and helping them choose the right professional.
- **Value of Reminder Systems**: A reminder system for appointments could improve punctuality and continuity of treatment, benefiting the studentâ€™s mental health.
