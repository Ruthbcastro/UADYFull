# Project Definition

## Problem

Students at the Autonomous University of Yucatán (UADY), particularly from the Faculty of Mathematics (FMAT), are facing an increase in mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. These problems have been exacerbated by a lack of adequate access to timely and accessible psychological services. In particular, the saturation of psychological services within the university has resulted in long waiting periods, making it difficult for students to receive the attention they need on time. This situation can lead to further deterioration of their emotional and academic well-being. Moreover, the absence of an efficient and accessible digital platform for scheduling appointments has been a significant barrier for students to manage their mental health needs proactively.

## Causes

The main cause of this issue lies in the lack of a technological solution that allows students to schedule appointments with psychologists in an easy, quick, and accessible manner. Current appointment systems are limited, and students face barriers such as lack of availability, long wait times, and a non-user-friendly interface, which further exacerbates the situation.

## Goal

To develop a **mobile application** focused on managing psychological appointments that offers FMAT students an accessible, efficient, and personalized platform to schedule appointments with specialized psychologists. The app should be user-friendly, allowing students to book appointments quickly, offering preferential prices for students, and providing the option for either online or in-person sessions. Additionally, the app must incorporate automatic reminder functionalities, personalized experiences, and an intuitive design to simplify the user interaction with the system.

## Social Relevance

This project holds high social relevance due to the growing need for psychological care among university students, especially in an era where mental health disorders are increasingly common. In Yucatán, the high suicide rate is linked to untreated mental health issues, highlighting the urgency of providing students with quick and easy access to psychological services. The proposed app will not only facilitate access to care but also contribute to improving the overall well-being of FMAT students, offering an accessible and reliable tool for managing their mental health.

## Innovation

The innovation of this project lies in creating a **centralized digital platform** that allows UADY students to schedule appointments with both internal and external psychologists at preferential prices. The app will differentiate itself through its **intuitive interface**, simplifying the appointment booking process, as well as offering **advanced functionalities** like personalized user experiences, automatic appointment reminders, and the option for **online sessions**. Furthermore, the app will not only manage appointments but also allow students to track their psychological treatment progress, providing additional support for mental health management.

## Feasibility

The feasibility of this project is supported by the high demand for psychological services among FMAT students, as shown by our preliminary research. Most students are willing to use an appointment scheduling app with preferential prices. The team possesses the technical capabilities required to develop the application and has identified key features through user studies, such as **ease of use**, **accessibility**, and **personalization of the experience**. The business model will focus on offering an accessible service at preferential prices, ensuring significant adoption among students.
