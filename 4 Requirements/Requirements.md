| **FR5**   | Functional       | Implement an interactive graph system that visualizes treatment factor levels and related notes.        | 1. **Exploration:** By clicking on a point in the graph, the user can obtain:<br> - The associated treatment factor (e.g., stress, anxiety).<br> - The date of the data point.<br> - The level or state of the selected factor.<br> - Notes provided by the psychologist.<br><br> 2. **Filter Customization:** The user can apply filters such as:<br> - Factor (e.g., stress, anxiety).<br> - Time range (weeks, months).<br> - Psychologist. Filters update the graph instantly. |
| **FR6**   | Functional       | Allow users to customize the graph through dynamic filters.                                             | Users can select and apply filters dynamically, choosing a treatment factor, a time range, and a psychologist. The graph updates immediately to reflect the filtered information.                                                             |
| **NFR2**  | Non-Functional   | Efficiency in data exploration (NFR02).                                                                 | Users must be able to interact with graphs (explore and apply filters) quickly, without errors, and with immediate feedback.                                                                                                                  |
