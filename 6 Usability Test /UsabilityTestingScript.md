# **Usability Testing Script**

## **Objective**
Assess the usability of the Figma prototype by evaluating how users explore and customize data related to treatment factor levels (stress, anxiety, etc.) using dynamic filters.

---

## **Preparation**

1. **Participants:**
   - Choose 3–5 users with varying levels of technological experience.
   - Ensure a mix of familiarity with visual tools to get diverse feedback.

2. **Environment:**
   - Load the Figma prototype on a stable device with a reliable internet connection.
   - Have a timer ready to measure task completion times.

3. **Instructions for Participants:**
   - Reassure them: “This is about testing the prototype, not your skills.”
   - Encourage them to share their thoughts as they complete the tasks.

## **Task 1: Exploring Graphs**

- **Goal:**  
  Understand if users can explore treatment factor levels (e.g., stress, anxiety) and find related comments through interaction with the graph.

- **Instructions:**  
  “Try interacting with the graph by clicking or hovering over the points to view details about treatment factors, such as stress or anxiety levels. Let me know what you discover.”

- **Observer Notes:**  
  - Time taken to find and explore information.  
  - Challenges faced while interacting with the graph.  
  - User reactions (e.g., confusion, ease of understanding).

## **Task 2: Customizing Graphs with Filters**

- **Goal:**  
  Evaluate how easily users apply filters to tailor the graph display.

- **Instructions:**  
  “Use the filters to select a date range and a specific factor (e.g., stress or anxiety). Watch how the graph updates based on your choices.”

- **Observer Notes:**  
  - Time taken to apply filters.  
  - Any confusion or errors while using the filters.  
  - Effectiveness of the updated graph.

## **Feedback and Reflection**

1. **Quick Survey:**  
   - Ask users to rate their experience on a scale of 1–5 for:  
     - Ease of use.  
     - Clarity of information.  
     - Filter application.  
     - Overall satisfaction.  

2. **Open Questions:**  
   - “What worked well for you in this design?”  
   - “Was there anything you found confusing or challenging?”  
   - “What would you change to make it easier to use?”

## **Post-Test Review**

1. **Metrics:**  
   - Success Rate: Did users complete tasks without errors?  
   - Completion Time: How long did tasks take?  
   - Common Difficulties: Were there patterns in user struggles?  

2. **Improvements:**  
   - Summarize feedback and identify areas to enhance usability.  

3. **Reporting:**  
   - Prepare a concise summary of findings with recommendations for adjustments.
