# **A) SELECTION OF USABILITY NFRs**

## **NFRs (Non-functional requirements) selected:**

1. **Efficiency in data exploration (NFR02):**  
   Users must be able to interact with graphs (explore and apply filters) quickly, without errors, and with immediate feedback.

2. **Clarity of visual information (NFR03):**  
   Graphs and visual elements must be clear, using labels and legends that allow users to easily interpret the levels of the treatment factors.

3. **Ease of filter customization (NFR04):**  
   The filters applied to the graphs must be intuitive and allow users to customize their searches without confusion.

## **Associated functional requirements:**

- **Visualization of treatment factor levels (FR05):**  
  Implement an interactive graph system that displays levels of treatment factors (such as stress, anxiety, and other emotional factors) from sessions, with options to explore related comments.

- **Customization of graphs and filters (FR06):**  
  Allow users to customize the graph visualization through dynamic filters that include date ranges and a factor to choose.

# **B) TEST PLAN**

## **1. Selection and number of participants:**

- **Profile:**  
  - Primary user: Students with a moderate level of experience in technology and visual analysis.  
  - Secondary user: Students with little technological experience or no prior familiarity with graphical tools.

- **Number of participants:**  
  3 to 5 users, with a balanced distribution of profiles to obtain a diverse perspective on usability.

## **2. Adjusted tasks and test scenarios:**

- **Task 1:** Exploration of levels in interactive graphs.  
  - **Scenario:** The user interacts with the graph to obtain information about treatment factor levels (stress, anxiety) and explore highlighted comments.  
  - **Objective:** Evaluate whether users understand how to explore the graphs and find the desired information without difficulty.

- **Task 2:** Customization of graphs with filters.  
  - **Scenario:** The user applies dynamic filters (by date and a chosen factor) to customize the information displayed on the graph.  
  - **Objective:** Evaluate whether users understand how to use the filters and get the expected results.

## **3. Estimated time per task:**

- **Task 1 (Graph exploration):** 3-5 minutes, considering initial navigation and information search.  
- **Task 2 (Filter customization):** 1-3 minutes, including selecting and applying dynamic filters.
