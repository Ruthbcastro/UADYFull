This repository contains the design and user experience (UX) documentation for UADY Full, an app aimed at simplifying the scheduling of psychological appointments for students at the Facultad de MatemÃ¡ticas (FMAT) of the Universidad AutÃ³noma de YucatÃ¡n (UADY). The app is designed using Figma and focuses on providing an intuitive, accessible, and personalized interface that helps students manage their mental health care more effectively.

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use visualization tool that enables students and psychologists to better understand treatment progress through interactive graphs. The system allows users to explore data points, apply dynamic filters, and gain insights into emotional health trends. This addresses the need for accessible tools that support mental health management and provide a clear picture of therapy outcomes.

## **Key Features**
- **Interactive Exploration**:  
  Users can click on data points within the graph to access detailed information such as:
  - Associated treatment factor (e.g., stress, anxiety).  
  - Date of the session.  
  - Level or state of the selected factor.  
  - Notes provided by the psychologist.  

- **Customizable Filters**:  
  Dynamic filters allow users to refine the graph display based on:
  - Treatment factor (e.g., stress, anxiety).  
  - Time range (e.g., weeks, months).  
  - Psychologist associated with the session.

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
  The graph updates instantly when filters are applied, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## **Tools Used**
- **Figma**:  
  The primary tool for designing and prototyping the interface, allowing for interactive usability testing.

## **Intended Users**
- **Primary Audience**:  
  Students at FMAT, UADY, who want to track their psychological treatment progress.  
- **Other Potential Users**:  
  Psychologists or institutions managing mental health data who require a clear, visual representation of treatment outcomes.

## **Purpose**
This project is aimed at simplifying the analysis of psychological treatment data, providing students and psychologists with a user-friendly tool to monitor emotional health over time. By combining intuitive design and efficient functionality, this system contributes to better mental health outcomes and data-driven insights.
